# candev_pdf2csv

We have created a python file that can be used to convert a pdf file to number of csv files depending upon the tables in the pdf file.
In the python file a user has to just umport the package and a function "extract_csv" should be called which takes the pdf file path as a parameter and returns a number of csv file in the "output_csv" folder.
